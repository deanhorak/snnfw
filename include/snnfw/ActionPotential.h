/**
 * @brief ActionPotential class representing a spike traveling through the network
 *
 * In biological neural networks, an action potential (also called a nerve impulse
 * or spike) is a rapid rise and fall in voltage or membrane potential across a
 * cellular membrane. Action potentials are the fundamental units of neural
 * communication, propagating along axons and across synapses.
 *
 * This class models an action potential as an event that:
 * - Originates from a specific synapse
 * - Is destined for a specific dendrite
 * - Has a scheduled delivery time (accounting for synaptic delay)
 * - Carries information about its source and destination
 *
 * The ActionPotential is created when a neuron fires and is scheduled for
 * delivery by the SpikeProcessor at the appropriate time.
 *
 * Reference:
 * - Hodgkin, A. L., & Huxley, A. F. (1952). A quantitative description of 
 *   membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve.
